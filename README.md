# 🌿 **Plant Disease Detection System**

The **Plant Disease Detection System** is an intelligent, AI-powered application designed to help farmers, researchers, and agricultural specialists identify plant diseases quickly and accurately. Using **deep learning** and **image processing**, the system analyzes leaf images and detects symptoms of diseases in real time.

This project improves early diagnosis, reduces crop loss, and supports sustainable farming by providing fast and reliable disease predictions directly from simple leaf images.
